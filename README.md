# 🧪 Product Analytics Basics

This repository introduces core product analytics techniques using Python. It covers key metrics like DAU/WAU/MAU, user retention, funnel conversion, and event-based behavior using synthetic data.

## 📊 Core Features

- Load and explore event data
- Calculate DAU, WAU, MAU
- Retention cohort analysis
- Funnel analysis
- Basic visualizations with Matplotlib/Seaborn

## 📁 Folder Structure

- `src/`: Contains core scripts
- `data/`: Sample event log data
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebook summarizing results

## 📦 Requirements

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

Run basic metrics:

```bash
python src/basic_metrics.py
```

Run retention analysis:

```bash
python src/retention_analysis.py
```

Run funnel analysis:

```bash
python src/funnel_analysis.py
```

## 📈 Sample Metrics

- DAU: Daily Active Users
- Retention Rate: % of users returning after N days
- Funnel Drop-off: % drop at each conversion step
